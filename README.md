# Game description and rules

A  similar game to hangman.
The game is a Single Player game where a player has to guess a certain word in the game within a given amount of time, and a limited number of guesses. As a player makes a wrong guess a stick figure is set up and the picture starts getting completed with each wrong guess. Very simply if a person manages to guess the word under the given restraints he wins. On the other hand, if he fails it results in a loss.
